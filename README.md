# cpp-sandbox

A personal sandbox for experimenting with modern and advanced C++ concepts — from multithreading and design patterns to graphics and systems programming.

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of C++ examples, mini-projects, and experiments built to explore:

- **CMake, Tests, and Tooling**
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- **Memory Management (Smart Pointers, RAII)**
- **Modern C++ Features (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Multithreading & Concurrency**
- **Networking (Sockets, UDP/TCP)**
- **Graphics & Game Development (SFML, Dear ImGui)**
